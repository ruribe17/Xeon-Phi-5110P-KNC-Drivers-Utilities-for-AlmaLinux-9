# Proposal: Developing Xeon Phi 5110P Support for AlmaLinux 9 (Kernel 5.14)

## Introduction

This proposal aims to establish the foundation for developing **full support for the Intel Xeon Phi 5110P coprocessor** on **AlmaLinux 9**, specifically targeting **kernel 5.14** and related updates in the **EL9 ecosystem**. By building a **modern, community-maintained kernel module** (`mic.ko`) and updating essential user-space utilities, this project will ensure that aging Xeon Phi hardware can regain relevance for **AI inference**, **parallel processing**, and **scientific computing** — with a special focus on **affordable AI infrastructure for educational institutions**.

This repository (once published) will become the **central hub** for development efforts, documentation, and collaboration.

---

## Background and Justification

### Discontinued Hardware with Untapped Potential
The **Intel Xeon Phi 5110P**, part of Intel’s now-discontinued **Many Integrated Core (MIC)** architecture, provided exceptional parallel processing power at relatively low cost. However, official support for this hardware ended years ago, and **modern distributions like AlmaLinux 9 (kernel 5.14)** no longer ship compatible drivers or the necessary **Manycore Platform Software Stack (MPSS)**.

### Educational Institutions Need Affordable AI Power
In regions such as **Lima, Peru**, educational institutions often face **severe budget constraints**, limiting their access to modern **AI-capable infrastructure**. By reviving support for the Xeon Phi 5110P on contemporary Linux platforms, this project offers a **cost-effective path** to deploy AI tools for **personalized learning**, **automated grading**, and **intelligent tutoring systems**.

---

## Target Operating System and Kernel Versions

This project will **target the following environment:**

| Distribution | Kernel Version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| AlmaLinux 9 | 5.14.x | Primary Target |
| Rocky Linux 9 | 5.14.x | Secondary Target (Compatibility) |
| RHEL 9 (upstream reference) | 5.14.x | Reference Only |

The project will follow **AlmaLinux 9’s lifecycle**, ensuring long-term compatibility until **2032**.

---

## Objectives

### 1. Develop Modern Kernel Module (`mic.ko`)
- Analyze the **MPSS 3.8.6 kernel module** (last working on CentOS 7/8 with kernel 3.10 and 4.18).
- Refactor and adapt to support **kernel 5.14** and **modern device management interfaces**.
- Package as an **RPM for easy deployment** on AlmaLinux 9.

### 2. Update Essential User-Space Utilities
- Port and test the following MPSS components for **EL9**:
    - `libmicmgmt`
    - `libscif`
    - `mpss-daemon`
    - `micctrl`, `micinfo`, `miccheck`
- Replace deprecated libraries or features (e.g., Python 2 dependencies).

### 3. Publish Complete Documentation
- Step-by-step installation and configuration guides.
- Explanation of **kernel module compatibility challenges** and solutions.
- Practical case studies for **AI inference**, **matrix computation**, or **parallel model training** on Xeon Phi.

---

## Why Focus on AlmaLinux 9?

✅ **RHEL-Compatible**: Direct compatibility with industry-standard RHEL clones, including **Rocky Linux** and **Oracle Linux**.  
✅ **Long-Term Support**: Guaranteed updates until **2032**.  
✅ **Community Driven**: Ideal platform for educational and research use.  
✅ **Modern Kernel and Toolchain**: Ships with **kernel 5.14**, **GCC 11**, **glibc 2.34**, and **systemd 249** — all requiring compatibility work for legacy MPSS components.

---

## Strategic Impact

### For Educational Institutions
- **Low-Cost AI Infrastructure**: Repurpose affordable or donated Xeon Phi hardware for AI workloads.
- **Modern Security**: Run AI applications on a supported, patched OS with current security practices.
- **Learning Platform**: Provides real-world case studies for **open hardware integration** into education.

### For Open-Source Community
- **Rescue Legacy Hardware**: Preserves the value of Xeon Phi hardware, aligning with **open hardware reuse** principles.
- **Kernel Adaptation Blueprint**: Serves as a case study for adapting out-of-tree drivers to modern kernels.
- **Collaborative Development**: Invites contributions from kernel developers, hardware enthusiasts, and educational technologists.

## Technical Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel API Changes | Many interfaces changed between **3.10 → 5.14** | Review upstream kernel commits and rewrite affected code. |
| Systemd Integration | MPSS expects legacy init system | Convert all management to **systemd units**. |
| Library Compatibility | Deprecated dependencies (Python 2, old glibc) | Patch for Python 3, rebuild with **glibc 2.34**. |
| Device Enumeration | Kernel’s PCI device handling evolved | Use **modern PCI enumeration APIs**. |

---

## Project Timeline (Tentative)

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| Initial Analysis | 4 weeks | Compatibility Report |
| Kernel Module Porting | 8 weeks | mic.ko for 5.14 |
| User-Space Porting | 6 weeks | Updated MPSS Utilities |
| Packaging & Documentation | 4 weeks | RPMs + Full Docs |
| Testing & Validation | 4 weeks | Real-World AI Workload Tests |
| Community Outreach | Ongoing | Blog, Talks, Collaboration |
